To send data from a Laravel API to a Facebook Pixel, you need to use the Facebook Conversions API (CAPI). Unlike the traditional browser-based pixel, CAPI sends server-to-server events, making tracking more reliable and accurate by bypassing browser restrictions and ad blockers. 
This process involves several key steps: generating an access token in your Meta Events Manager, using an HTTP client in your Laravel app to send data to the Conversions API endpoint, and sending an Event ID to avoid data duplication.
